# Early-Forest-Fire-Detection

 Forest fires are occurring throughout the year with an increasing intensity in the summer and autumn periods. These events are mainly caused by the actions of humans or sometimes nature itself.
This project involves various real-time forest fire detection and prediction approaches, with the goal of informing the local fire authorities.
